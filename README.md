# MECH105_MAYBERRY
MATLAB Algorithms
This repository contains all of the MATLAB algorithms that I created and used during the summer 2021 semester of MECH 105.  Many of these MATLAB algorithms will require that the user input a function and when run, many of the codes will require additional input.  The descriptions for each algorithm will be included.
